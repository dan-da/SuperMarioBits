## Super mario bits

#### Intro

This is our entry for Bithack 2015. What we've done is added bitcoin goodness to SuperMario so the coins have real value!

Receive Bitcoin for coins collected after each level. Each coin is worth a Penny.

Payouts are made via ChangeTip. No account or bitcoin address needed before playing!

We also modified some of the images for extra bitcoin fun.

This game is derived from "FULL SCREEN MARIO" by JOSHUA K. GOLDBERG.

The FullScreenMario project started October 21st, 2012. The initial beta release in October 2013 saw the [primary host website](http://www.fullscreenmario.com) receive approximately 2.68 million unique visitors within a month, after which Nintendo shut the site down with a DMCA complaint (no action was taken against GitHub or other hosting websites). The coding project then underwent an extensive rewrite and architecture change to become a modular project centered on the [EightBittr and GameStartr](GameStartr/) platform.
