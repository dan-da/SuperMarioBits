## Super mario bits

#### Intro

This is our entry for Bithack 2015. What we've done is added bitcoin goodness to SuperMario so the coins have real value!

Receive Bitcoin for coins collected after each level. Each coin is worth a Penny.

Payouts are made via ChangeTip. No account or bitcoin address needed before playing!

We also modified some of the images for extra bitcoin fun.

This game is derived from "FULL SCREEN MARIO" by JOSHUA K. GOLDBERG.
